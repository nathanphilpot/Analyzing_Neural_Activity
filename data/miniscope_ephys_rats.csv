I had given him one dose of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine at the beginning of the surgery, so I decided to give him a second dose as the surgery was ending. Although it was less than 6 hours later, I figured it was OK since the allowable range was 0.05-0.1 mg/kg. I think it was this second dose that may have caused him to stop breathing. I tried reviving him with chest compressions, but it did not work."
R211013,210812,M,Sprague-Dawley,,,,,,,,[1.0; 4.0],,,,,,"No cell activity at first. ~1 month in, cell activity! The electrowetting lens is at the extreme value, though, and it's still not completely in focus, so maybe in the future you need to put the EWL at 0 when you epoxy the GRIN lens in the baseplate. When I recorded from this rat again, there was no activity again. So the window of optimal imaging can be quite small!"
